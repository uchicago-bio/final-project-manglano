RMSD calculators and optimal rotation of sets of coordinates.

Two algorithms are provided: 

1. The standard SVD decomposition using the numpy library.
2. The qcp quaternion-based method that doesn't need numpy.

The qcp method is particularly useful because it allows the
library to function without numpy such as when run with pypy.
